Hi, my name's Gabriele Polastri. I'm a first-year Computer Science student at Sapienza University of Rome. Here you will find my projects in robotics, embedded systems, and programming.
While I enjoy hobbies like playing video games, reading, and watching movies, I dedicate most of my free time to expanding my knowledge in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.
